> ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ This repo is deprecated, learn how to build these types of applications in [https://github.com/build-on-aws/rag-postgresql-agent-bedrock](https://github.com/build-on-aws/rag-postgresql-agent-bedrock) ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨

In this repository you will find a use cases of RAG on AWS using [CDK](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/home.html). 

Additionally,  you will find a notebook where you can run the agent localy.

Multilingual (limited to the LLM you use) agent with memory capable of following a more fluid conversation (learn more about using memories with agents [here](https://community.aws/posts/working-with-your-live-data-using-langchain)) to query [the re:invent 2023 agenda](https://hub.reinvent.awsevents.com/attendee-portal/catalog/) by session ID or by description or general information, it also recommend a list of sessions according to your input.

## Let's build!

âœ… **Clone the repo**

```
git clone https://github.com/build-on-aws/qa-agent-with-bedrock-kendra-and-history-memory.git
```

âœ… **Go to**: 

```
cd re-invent-agent
```

âœ… **Create The Virtual Environment**: by following the steps in the [README](/re-invent-agent/README.md)

```
python3 -m venv .venv
```

```
source .venv/bin/activate
```
for windows: 

```
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

âœ… **Install The Requirements**:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

âœ… **Synthesize The Cloudformation Template With The Following Command**:

```
cdk synth
```

âœ…ðŸš€ **The Deployment**:

```
cdk deploy
```

âœ… **Review what is deployed in the stack:** 

- Go to the [AWS Cloudformation console](console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation), select the region where you deployed and click on `ReInventAgentStack`:

Then go to the resources tab and explore what's deployed:

âœ… **Test The Agent Locally:** [Here](re-invent-agent.ipynb)

âœ… **Test The Agent:**

- [Testing Lambda Functions In The Console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/testing-functions.html):

Go to the [Lamnda Function console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/lambda/home#/functions), serarch and choose the lambda function that starts with the name `ReInventAgentStack-Fnagent`

![Digrama parte 1](/imagenes/image_03.png)

Choose the Test tab.

![Digrama parte 1](/imagenes/image_05.png)

Under Test event, choose Create new event, in **Event Json** create a event like this: 

```
{
  "prompt": "I'm looking for a session about generative ai",
  "session_id": "1"
}
```

![Digrama parte 1](/imagenes/image_04.png)


Saved event and **Test**. 

Check the response when finished.

> When we ask for ID, the agent consults Amazon DynamoDB

![Digrama parte 2](/imagenes/video_2.gif)


- [Testing Lambda Functions With Boto3](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/lambda/client/invoke.html):

In this [notebook](/test_lambda_function.ipynb) you can find the code to test locally.



> Play with the agent and improve the prompt, remember that he has memory storage and you can have a fluid conversation with it.
